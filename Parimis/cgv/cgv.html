          <h1 class="text-center">TERMS OF SALES</h1>
          <p class="fw-bold">1. APPLICATION</p>
          <p>
            These general sales conditions (hereinafter: “GSCs”) apply to the
            sales made by the Hotel (hereinafter: “the Company”) with the
            Client.
          </p>
          <p>
            They cancel and replace any prior version that has been placed
            online and/or accepted by the Client.
          </p>
          <p>
            These GSCs apply to all uses of the site, notably, to the
            commercialisation, by Internet and by telephone, of all of the
            services offered on the Site by LES HOTELS PARIMIS.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is therefore critical that the Client read attentively the GSCs
            that are referenced by hypertext link on each page of the site. In
            particular, the Client is advised to download and/or print these on
            the day of his/her order, so as to keep a copy of these, as they are
            subject to modification. However, it is hereby stipulated that such
            modifications shall be inapplicable to the orders of Services placed
            previously.
          </p>
          <p>
            The GSCs can be supplemented by specific sales conditions contained
            in the description of the service, as well as by the general
            conditions of the providers, which can be accessed either on their
            Internet Site, or on the premises.
          </p>
          <p class="fw-bold">2. CAPACITY</p>
          <p>
            The Client acknowledges that s/he has the capacity to enter into a
            contract, i.e. that it is an adult as defined by law and is not
            under guardianship or trusteeship.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Client also declares that it will use the Site in accordance
            with these GSCs, in its name and on behalf of all of the
            beneficiaries of the services ordered by it on the Site, of which it
            acknowledges that it is the representative (hereinafter: the
            “Beneficiaries”) and on which these GSCs are binding.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Client is financially responsible for the use of the Site in
            both his/her own name and on behalf of the Beneficiaries, unless
            s/he demonstrates fraudulent use that does not result from any fault
            or negligence by her/him.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Client warrants the veracity and the accuracy of the information
            provided by him/her in its name and on behalf of all of the
            Beneficiaries using its data on the Site.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Company reserves the right at any time not to enter into a
            contract with a Client who engages in fraudulent use of the Site or
            that violates these GSCs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The terms of Article 313-1 of the French Criminal Code [Code Pénal]
            are hereby recalled in this connection:
          </p>
          <p>
            "Fraud is characterised either by the use of a false name or a false
            status, or by the misuse of a genuine status, or by the use of
            fraudulent ploys to deceive a natural person or legal entity and to
            define it as such, to its prejudice or to the prejudice of a
            third-party, to submit funds, securities, or any asset, to supply a
            service, or to grant an act entailing an obligation or a release.
            Fraud is punished by five years of imprisonment and a fine of €
            375,000.”
          </p>
          <p class="fw-bold">3. RIGHT TO CANCEL</p>
          <p>
            Pursuant to the provisions of Article L 121-21-8 of the French
            Consumption Code [Code de laConsommation], the services offered on
            the Site by the Company are not subject to the application of the
            right to cancel mentioned in Articles L. 121-21 et seq. of the
            Consumption Code concerning sales at a distance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consequently, the services ordered on the Site are exclusively
            subject to the cancellation and modification conditions contained in
            these GSCs and the Client cannot invoke the right to cancel.
          </p>
          <p class="fw-bold">4. PRICES</p>
          <p>
            The prices are indicated in euros. VAT is included in the prices
            indicated. Any change of the applicable rate, or any modification or
            introduction of new official taxes established by the competent
            authorities, shall be automatically passed onto the prices indicated
            on the invoice date.
          </p>
          <p>
            The prices are understood to cover one room for the number of
            persons indicated and in accordance with the period selected.
          </p>
          <p>
            The prices indicated only include the services specifically
            mentioned in the reservation. The price mentioned in the reservation
            shall be increased by the price of the additional services supplied
            by the hotel at the time of the stay, and, if applicable, the
            visitors tax.
          </p>
          <p>
            The prices mentioned on the Site are subject to modification at any
            time by the Hotel without prior information or notice. Only the
            price indicated in the reservation confirmation by the Company is
            contractual.
          </p>
          <p>
            No stay reserved prior to the introduction of a promotional offer

          </p>
          <p class="fw-bold">5. ONLINE ORDERS</p>
          <p>
            The confirmation of the order entails acceptance of these sales
            conditions, acknowledgment of full cognisance thereof, and an
            undertaking not to rely on his/her own purchasing conditions or
            other conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Company shall send the Client, by any means (e-mail, regular
            postal mail, fax, etc.) confirmation of the recorded order.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reservation is only firm and final after the Client has received
            the confirmation sent by the Company.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rates, terms and conditions of reservations are intended for the
            sale of hotel rooms in accordance with their primary purpose:
            accommodation. The hotel reserves the right to modify or cancel the
            reservation (s), as well as the rates and conditions if the rooms
            are used for other purposes such as parties, dinners, meetings,
            photo or video shootings, film or interview shoots, written or
            filmed interviews, shootings for social networks, showrooms etc…
            (non-exhaustive list) without prior written authorization from the
            hotel general manager. The number of guests in the rooms may not
            exceed the number of people reserved and may not exceed the maximum
            capacity of the rooms declared to the Paris Police Prefecture
            (declaration available from the hotel management).
          </p>
          <p class="fw-bold">6. ONLINE PAYMENT CONDITIONS</p>
          <p>
            According to the type of reservation made, the price is due in full
            at the time of the placing of the order (advance purchase style
            plan) or at the end of the Client’s stay at the Hotel (flexible
            plan).
          </p>
          <p>
            Regardless of the circumstances and in order to guarantee his/her
            reservation, the Client is asked to communicate his/her credit card
            number, which shall be transmitted by secure means.
          </p>
          <p>
            If payment is made at the time the order is placed, the credit card
            information transmitted by the Client to the Company via a secure
            system shall enable the latter to debit the card for the total
            amount of the stay, in all cases by secure means. The Client’s
            credit card is debited on the day of the order; the invoice is
            transmitted by the Company to the Client on the day the Client
            leaves the Hotel.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please be advised that the credit card used to make the reservation
            must be presented at check-in, as well as valid identification. The
            cardholder’s name must match the guest’s name. If the same credit
            card cannot be presented, the guest will need to present a new
            credit card for full payment to be taken.
          </p>
          <p>
            Third-Party Credit Card: if a non-guest wishes to pay for a guest in
            the hotel, the hotel will require specific documents prior to the
            guest’s arrival in order to prevent bank card fraud.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note that the hotel may proceed to a pre-authorization on
            your credit card to ensure sufficient funds are available to cover
            the charges for your stay at any time prior to arrival.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            The modification and/or cancellation of a reservation is only firm
            and final after receipt of a confirmation by e-mail from the
            Company.
          </p>
          <p>
            The date of receipt of the modification and/or cancellation request
            (by e-mail, postal mail, telephone) is the date used for the
            cancellation.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the Client opts for an advance purchase style plan, no
            modification or cancellation shall be accepted and the total amount
            of the stay shall be kept by the Hotel and the Client shall not be
            entitled to request any reimbursement.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the Client does not come to the Hotel, and in the absence of
            cancellation: The entire amount of the reservation shall be kept by
            the Hotel in the case of an “Advance purchase style plan”
            reservation; The first night shall be debited by the Hotel in the
            event of a “Flexible plan” reservation.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, for a stay of at least 2 nights, if the Client does not
            come to the Hotel on the first day of the stay, the Hotel shall not
            be required to keep the room available to the Client for the
            remainder of the stay.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Client is asked to arrive at the Hotel on the check-in day prior
            to 6 pm and to notify the hotel if s/he will arrive after 6 pm,
            failing which s/he shall be considered as not having come to the
            Hotel on the first day of the stay.
          </p>
          <p class="fw-bold">8. TRANSFER OF THE CLIENT TO ANOTHER HOTEL</p>
          <p>
            If the Hotel is not available, or in a force majeure situation, the
            Hotel reserves the right to have the Client stay, for all or part of
            the duration of the stay, in a hotel of an equivalent or higher
            category, offering services of the same type. In this case, the
            transfer shall be paid for by the hotel, which cannot be asked to
            pay any additional compensation.
          </p>
          <p class="fw-bold">9. RELATED SERVICES & PACKAGES</p>
          <p>
            Orders for related services and/or packages can only be placed at
            the same time as the reservation of a stay at the hotel on a given,
            predetermined date.
          </p>
          <p>
            They can only be used by the Client during the Client’s stay at the
            Hotel. They can only be modified and/or cancelled in the conditions
            defined in Article VII of this document.
          </p>
          <p class="fw-bold">10. FORCE MAJEURE</p>
          <p>
            Force majeure is understood as any event that is unrelated to the
            parties and that is both unforeseeable and insurmountable, that
            prevents either the client, or the hotelier, from performing all or
            some of the obligations contained in the contract.
          </p>
          <p>
            In particular, Clients shall only pay all of the additional expenses
            that could be incurred in order to make it possible to continue the
            trip, following the occurrence of a force majeure situation.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            The Client shall be held responsible for any damage, deterioration,
            or any act of vandalism that could occur as a result of the
            occupancy of the premises and/or due to the act or fault of the
            participants and/or of the personal for which the Client is
            responsible, to movable property, decorations and immovable
            property, whether or not these belong to the hotel. Accordingly, the
            Company is fully entitled to ask the Client to vacate the hotel

            in progress, and to reimburse the damages caused by these acts.
          </p>
